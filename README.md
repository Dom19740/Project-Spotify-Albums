# Project-Spotify-Albums
 A personal project using Python and Selenium to add lists of mp3 album titles to Spotify.

 It was written in order to overcome the fact that there is no way importing album lists into Spotify

 This was a 2 stage project, the first stage was to use Python to read the album titles from mp3 albums into a text file
 
 The second stage was to use Python and Selenium to go through the list and automate the browser to search for, and select the albums and and then to my Liked Albums.
